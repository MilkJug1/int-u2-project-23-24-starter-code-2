      <p>Open Source software is software where it's code is freely available and open to anyone contributing.
        Open source is very important to how certain apps, programs, and even games function.
        Unfortunately, people don't know about what open source software, and think it's bad to use since anyone can contribute. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Open source is really important, it's applications that power other applications, stuff that respects settings and privacy, 
        and it is always something you can trust(Unless it's an open source app that's backed by a company). 
        Most open source apps collect no data whatsoever, if any do, they will always ask instead of taking. And will respect your option and not collect any,
        or anonymize the data. Plus, they know what their users want, and listen to them, unlike other companies (Looking at you Adobe)

        Now, if one wants to join and try out more open-source software, I recommend looking up alternatives of your favorite program. In fact, heres a github of alternatives to popular
        software, <a href="https://github.com/sereneblue/awesome-oss">Click here for the List!</a>

      Now, you might be asking yourself, why should I switch? My software works fine for me? I don't need to switch.
      Well if you have been keeping up with recent times, you probably have seen more and more companies try to find more ways to scrape more data off of you(Same with the government too!)
      An example of this would be Microsoft and how they are handling Windows 11, the whole operating system is riddled with ads, data scrapers in order to serve personalized ads to you, and applications, 
      and captures what you are doing.
